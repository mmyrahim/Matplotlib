matplotlib-challenge
The analysis was performed using the Matplotlib library in Python to generate visualizations and summarize the study results. The goal was to create tables, figures, and statistical summaries required for the technical report of the clinical study.

To perform the analysis, I relied on the functionality provided by Pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It allowed me to efficiently process and analyze the standardized test data.

Throughout the analysis, I referenced the Pandas documentation (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) to explore different functionalities and methods available in the library. Additionally, I consulted the Jupyter Notebook documentation (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to leverage the features of Jupyter notebooks for an interactive and informative analysis.
